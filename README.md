# recognize-digits
Neural Network (create from scratch) that recognize digits, the model has been trained on the mnist datasets, with images of 28x28 dimension

## Network
The network has 5 layers: [784, 128, 128, 128, 128, 10], use Adam optimization with parameters write in the hyperparameters.py file,
has reached an accuracy of about 97%, i've tried a lot of differenet hyperparameters and this is the best accuracy that i've been able
to reached
